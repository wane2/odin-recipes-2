    <h1>Mandazi Recipe</h1>

    <img>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mandazis are amazingly soft, triangle-shaped
         donuts famous in East Africa, where I am
          from. They are excellent with a cup of tea 
          or coffee. The dash of cardamom adds an authentic taste, making them different from regular donuts. You can serve them with honey or jam. Mandazis can also be served with curry, which is how we like them.

    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup fine white sugar</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons instant yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying, or as needed
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour, sifted
        </li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine milk, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, sugar, egg, instant yeast, salt, and cardamom in a large bowl. Mix in flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough comes together and is easily handled. Knead dough on a flat work surface until no longer sticky. Return dough to the bowl; cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Press dough down gently. Knead briefly, then divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball; keep covered with a cloth to prevent dough from drying.
        </li>
        <li>Roll 1 dough ball into a 1/3-inch-thick circle on a floured work surface. Cut into 4 triangles using a pizza cutter; cover with a cloth. Repeat with remaining dough balls.</li>
        <li>Heat 2-inches oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry dough in hot oil until puffed, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip dough and continue frying until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.s</li>
      </ol>
