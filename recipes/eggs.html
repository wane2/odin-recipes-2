    <h1>Turkish Eggs Recipe</h1>
     <h2>Ingridients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 red chilli finely choped</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove chopped</li>
        <li>200g greek yoghurt</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon juiced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 medium eggs</li>
        <li>choriander</li>
        <li>toast, to serve</li>
      </ul.
     <h2>Method</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Put the chilli and butter in a small pan and melt on a very gentle heat to ensure the chilli flavour infuses while you make the rest of the dish.</li>
        <li>Whisk the garlic into the yogurt. Season well and add the lemon juice. Bring a large pan of water to a simmer. Add the vinegar, make a swirl with a large spoon, then crack each egg into the water. Poach for 3 mins until set, then drain on kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>To serve, put half the yogurt in each bowl, add a poached egg to each, then drizzle with the melted chilli butter. Season, top with sumac and coriander leaves, and serve with toast.</li>
     </ol>
