    <h1>Headache Balm Recipe</h1>
      <p>With just a few ingredients, you can make an effective 
        headache balm that will work well and cost you very little.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup coconut oil - not fractionated </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon shea butter, cocoa butter, or a mixture of the two</li>
            <li>12 drops peppermint essential oil</li>
            <li>12 drops lavender essential oil</li>
            <li>small wide-mouth jar or small tins </li>
         </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Place coconut oil and shea or cocoa butter in a glass bowl and place over a pot of hot water, creating a makeshift double boiler. </li>
            <li>Heat until completely melted. Add the essential oils and pour into small containers. Allow it to cool on the countertop. Label and cover when cool.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>To use, simply swipe fingers across the top of the headache balm and apply to temples or forehead for relief. This may seem greasy at first, but it will be absorbed quickly.</p>
